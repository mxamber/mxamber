Pusher of buttons, opener of issues, and not much else. In my own repos, I usually post obscure weird stuff that nobody needs and self-written tools that are more programming exercises than production-ready releases. In other people's repos, I mostly open issues. I taught myself and you can tell. Programming mostly in Javascript (hate it) and C# (like it). Loves type safe languages, hates type inference. Oh and I love the crap out of regular expressions (until I don't).

All that being said, I *do* have a few repos that are actually more than just exercises for my coding muscles. Those being:

* [RPCMC](https://github.com/mxamber/RPCMC), a now-presumably-obsolete tool for creating empty resource packs (written when I still played Minecraft, not updated since Minecraft 1.11)
* [ScrapingFromOurOwn](https://github.com/mxamber/ScrapingFromOurOwn) (SFO2) and [AO3scrape](https://github.com/mxamber/AO3scrape), a semi-workable DLL and CLI client to fetch (read: scrape and regex) publicly available data from AO3, who have been promising an API on the road map for years and have jack shit to show for it yet.
* [DavidSarifBot](https://github.com/mxamber/DavidSarifBot), a nodejs-based Twitter bot posting *Deus Ex: Human Revolution* quotes (and butchering them into new ones). Currently live as [@DavidSarif](https://twitter.com/DavidSarif) on Twitter.
* [untitled timeline tool](https://github.com/mxamber/TimelineTool), one of my first larger HTML/JS ventures into redrawing UI. Editable timelines, save/load to/from JSON. It's not much, but it's honest work.
